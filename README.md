# Chess

In-work attempt at a Chess game on the command line.

## Introduction

Initially started the work on this in December 2019, and work intensely for a few weeks, but stopped and didn't continue until May and into June 2019. From there it took half a year before I continued once again, in December 2020. At this point I started rewriting the chess engine because I was not happy with the first implementation. It was hard to understand, full of edge-cases and I wanted to see if I could do better. That's what I'm doing now.
